To create this program I will utilize 4 seperate class file one containing the student and all of their non address information. Using the 
Extension feature we can extend student to the address class which will allow easy access to edit the data within the address class. To populate these classes
I will use a loop to create and instance of student then use a scanner to take in the data from the file and seperate using .split(). The result
of the .split operation will be used to populate the class student and then this class will be put on the stack before being replaced by the next entry.
To retrieve data from the stack annother loop will be utilized to assign the items on the stack to a new instance of the student class. The 
data can then be printed from this and displayed on the screen. The process will repeat by reassigning values to the instance of student until all
data has been printed.

To create the game of horse I will create a player class to store all the methods
to make the game run. There will be two private variables one that stores the score numerically, and one that stores the score in a char array.
There will be a default constructor that allocates the array on the heap then an initialization function will initialize the array to contain spaces.
There will be a shot method that generates a random number for each player class. These numbers will be compaired to determine who make the shot.
There are also getters and setter for each of the private variables. The destructor will delete the char array generated in the constructor.
There are 4 conditions that determine how the game flows. If either play scores and the other doesn't then the player that missed gets a letter.
If both or neither hit then the loop continues until one hits and one misses. Each time a person misses and the other hits the score counter is incremeted by 1 and the string for that player gains a letter.
To break the loop the scores of each player are looked at and if they are greater than 5 then the loop exits and the winner is displayed.
The destructor for each player is then called and the user is prompted if they want to continue or not.
The program will exit if No is selected or continue from the begining if yes.

To create the spartan race program I will first initialize two variables that will store the position of the racers.
From there I will write the intro text statements to the race then using three functions I will progress the race until the victory condition is met.
To advance each racer a random number will be generated from 1-10 then based on this number the racer will either advance or retreat.
The same process will be used for racer b. Within the main function there will be statements to control the racers from reaching undesired outputs such as falling below zero.
Also if the racers land on eachother racer a will be decremented by 1 space. To print I will utilize a loop that will print spaces except when the value of the control variable is equal to the racers position.
The order of the functions will be advanceA advanceB printRace. This will be contained in a while loop that will repeat until the victory condition of 50 is met.
Once the victory condition is me the winner will be announced and the loop will break thus ending the program.
